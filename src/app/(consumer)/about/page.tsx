                    The owners/managers of Nelson Lee Tree Farm, LLC are local,
                    originally from Lexington, Kentucky, eventually
                    transplanting to Southern Woodford County where they now
                    find themselves deeply rooted on a 30+ acre farm on the
                    corner of Troy Pike (Hwy 33) and Cummins Ferry Road.
                    <br></br>
                    <br></br>
                    What began as a dream, a vision, lots of prayer, moments of
                    uncertainty and admittedly some doubt, the tree farm turned
                    into a reality with lots of hard work and the blessings of
                    God!
                    <br></br>
                    <br></br>
                    The owner has worked in a few of the local garden centers
                    over the years and on his previous mini-farm, planted and
                    maintained various trees and shrubs while managing vegetable
                    gardens with modest success. This tree farm is a new kind of
                    business, but he has significant experience in other
                    business ventures.

          Lexington Rescue Mission since 2002, therefore Nelson Lee Tree Farm
          will direct a percentage of their profits to the Rescue Mission and
